## Tekton Triggers v0.8.1

## Fixes :bug:
* Handle validation, defaults and working behavior for Replicas ([#751](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/751))

If provided replicas value as 0 as part of EventListener spec then a default value 1 will be set by webhook.

* Merge annotations before propagation ([#753](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/753))

Triggers no longer overwrites annotations set on the underlying deployment and service objects.

* Add a Idle Timeout for EventListener sink ([#755](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/755))

EventListeners close idle connections after 120 seconds.

## Docs :book:
* Add release links to versioned docs for v0.8.0 ([#749](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/749))
