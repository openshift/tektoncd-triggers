## Tekton Triggers v0.7.0

## Features

* Add CEL function to parse YAML ([#636](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/636))

This PR will add a CEL function named parseYAML that can parse a YAML string into a map of strings to dynamic values
Syntax: .parseYAML() -> map<string, dyn>

* Expose the incoming request URL to CEL expressions ([#647](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/647))

This adds a requestURL key to the CEL expression context.
For example, requestURL.parseURL().path would get the path of the incoming request URL.

* Improve the error from the context evaluation ([#646](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/646))

Improve the error messages around parsing CEL expressions.
This improves the granularity of the error messages that are returned by evaluating expressions.
It also improves the error message when parsing the hook body when creating the evaluation environment.

* Support for marshaling other types in CEL ([#668](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/668))

This adds support for marshaling bool values, and maps if they're used as the
values of expressions in a CEL overlay.

* Add nodeSelector and replicas to Eventlistener ([#625](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/625))

Add nodeSelector and replicas feature to eventListener. With this, user could schedule eventListener pod to the node with
specific label. Also, if needed, user could specify the number of replicas in yaml file.

* Provide the incoming EventListener URL to the Webhook Interceptor ([#669](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/669))

Webhook Interceptors can parse the EventListener-Request-URL if they want to
extract parameters from the original request URL being handled by the
EventListener.

## Breaking Changes :rotating_light:
* Remove deprecated $(params) ([#690](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/690))

This is a breaking change as this PR remove complete support of $(params) and moved to $(tt.params) in order to avoid confusion between resourcetemplates and triggertemplate params

## Fixes :bug:
* Fix getting-started triggers ([#642](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/642))
The EventListener was referring to the Binding via name instead of ref. Also, run the getting-started
examples as part of the e2e YAML tests. While this won't catch all issues with the examples, it should
catch obvious syntax issues like this one.

* Pass url through ([#657](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/657))
Fix a bug in the sink where is not passing the URL through to the incoming requests.

* Fix install links for nginx ingress for GKE ([#685](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/685))
* Fix typo in README.md of getting started ([#688](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/688))
* Fix triggertemplate validation to validate missing spec field ([#691](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/691))
* Fix Spelling Mistake in TestCase ([#683](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/683))

## Misc :hammer:
* Change token to secret in gitlab example ([#659](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/659))
* Fix License copyright year ([#655](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/655))
* Use sets.NewString instead of map[string]struct{} ([#663](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/663))
* Update to pipeline knative 0.15 ([#661](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/661))
* Update tektoncd/pipeline to v0.14.2 ([#684](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/684))
* Update golang.org/x/text to v0.3.3 ([#674](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/674))

## Docs :book:
* Add cel filter for pull request actions in github example ([#637](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/637))
* Update docs and examples to use ref instead of name for bindings ([#645](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/645))
* Add EventListener Response in the Doc ([#664](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/664))
* Replace old Release docs in favor of a cheat sheet ([#670](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/670))
* Remove unused Ref from EventListenerTrigger ([#677](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/677))
* Prevent double-logging of interceptor errors ([#689](https://github.com/tektoncd/triggers/pull/689))
